# Short-Term Memory Optimization in Recurrent Neural Networks by Autoencoder-based Initialization
Experiments for the paper "Short-Term Memory Optimization in Recurrent Neural Networks by Autoencoder-based Initialization" presented at the Beyond Backpropagation workshop (NeurIPS 2020).

To run the experiments you also need [cannon](https://github.com/AntonioCarta/cannon), my ML utility library.
